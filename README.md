# üõ°Ô∏è File Type Spoof Checker

**File Type Spoof Checker** is a simple Python tool that detects whether a file's actual content matches its extension. This helps identify files that are **masquerading** as something else ‚Äî a common technique used by malware to bypass filters or trick users.

---

## Features

- Detects mismatches between file extension and content
- Uses MIME type comparison for accurate detection
- Flags suspicious files (e.g., `.jpg` file that's really an `.exe`)
- Optionally uses `python-magic` for better content detection

---

## Why This Matters

Attackers often rename dangerous files (like `.exe`, `.js`) with safe-looking extensions (like `.jpg`, `.pdf`) to fool users or bypass security systems.

This tool helps detect such **spoofed files**, making it a useful addition to your **basic malware analysis** or **file forensics** workflow.
